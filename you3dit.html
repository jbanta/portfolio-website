        <div class="cs-body-txt">
          Near the start of my internship, You3Dit switched their model to provide B2B services but their website did not reflect that. My role was to redesign and develop a new landing page that highlighted their new services. In the scope of this project, I worked with the CEO of You3Dit for design review and a software team that integrated my code into a Ruby on Rails framework. The goals for my changes are to increase turnover rates, land more clients and set a new tone for You3Dit's branding.

          I dedicated time to further research how successful B2B companies design their landing pages and best practices to increase conversion rates. Using what I found, I wanted to get down the key points that the website needed to get across that it didn't have before: You 3Dit is a  B2B business, provides a service, provides 3D design and can deliver manufactured parts, and works with high-end clients. I did this by quickly sketching a layout to visualize how the content delivers its message as well as the order of the content.

            I put together a style guideline sheet for the landing page, gathered my sketches and proposed the direction of what the new landing page should look like to the CEO.
            <BR><BR>
            I wanted to use the company colors throughout the website so I had to think of a good way to use the bright and clashing greens and reds. I decided to go with milder greens as the main accents and using red sparingly to serve as the eye-catching CTA buttons. I wanted to use modern web design trends and illustrations such as 'flat design' and isometric illustrations to build trust with potential clients.

          I used Adobe XD to put together an initial wireframe to digitally get  the ideas down and get a feel for what the layout will look like. At this stage I only  gathered feedback from people within the company to ensure that I captured the essence of what You3Dit is. I then refined the design to what it would actually look like on a webpage based on the initial wireframe.

          I designed more pages such as the 'Our Services' and 'Contact' pages and gathered more feedback from design experts, real You3Dit clients , and neighboring startups in the co-working space You3Dit is stationed. I went through multiple design iterations until I, and the You3Dit team were happy with the design.

          I whole-heartedly believe that attractive visuals and branding consistency on a landing page where people form their first impressions of a company is extremely important in gaining a user's trust. I understand that any small hiccup of how a company presents itself can severely taint someone's opinion of that company. I did my best to make sure that every portion of the landing page looked like it belonged to You3Dit and employed known effective strategies for B2B landing pages to increase conversion rates.

          <div class="cs-body-txt col2" style="margin-top: 0;">
            I encourage the user to scroll down to learn more by using a continual graphic that spans farther than the height of most screens with a graphic illustration that peeks onto the page on first load.

            As the user scrolls further down I wanted them see the reputable companies You3Dit has worked with and selected testimonials to serve as proof that You3Dit works with high-end clients and delivers high-end work.

              I use milder, lighter greens throughout the page as backgrounds and accents and only used the darker green for headings until the user reaches the dark green block that holds the concluding call to action that encourages a user to become a client. I did this combined with a larger font size to make this area stronger.
              <BR><BR>
              I only used red to make clear where all the CTA buttons are as red tends to be a striking color especially when it is used sparingly and used against it's complimentary color, green.

          <div class="cs-body-txt" style="margin-top: 0;">
            Since You3Dit's logo is a combination mark, I wanted to only use one simple san serif typeface that complimented the logo's typeface, Cuprum. I found that Montserrat does the job well and its varying weights can be used for different headings and page content.
