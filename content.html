        I drafted the mockup on Adobe XD and created the graphic images on Adobe Illustrator before starting the development stage. We collected feedback from target clients, B2B companies, and design experts to iterate & optimize our design.

        I developed the pages with HTML, CSS, & Javascript to replicate the design mockup complete with animations, button highlighting, and carousels.

  <div class="content-subtitle">LANDING PAGE</div>
  <div class="content-text">
    I am working on a landing page to give these cards a strong online presence and direct customers to where they can purchase them. This will be a single-scrolling page that summarizes and displays how they can be used complete with examples, lists of features, and images.

  <div class="content-subtitle">OBJECTIVE</div>
  <div class="content-text">
    I give myself design prompts from <a href="http://www.dailyui.co/" class="text-link" target="_blank">www.dailyui.co</a> to train my design muscles on UI/UX design, branding identity, different design softwares, and design presentation. I aim to learn something new from each prompt and execute it the best way I can. I relieved the pressure of completing a prompt daily to ensure quality work and make time for higher priorities but I strive to make progress on a consistent basis.
